    "description": "Revball is an exciting new paddle ball game for the OUYA!  Part pinball, part ping-pong, but completely unique, Revball is a fast paced game of skill. It's Blue versus Green in a single or multi-player competition.\r\n\r\nThe object is to strategically hit the ball with your paddle to keep it from escaping the circular arena. Miss the ball, and your opponent gets a point.  Grab the powerups when they appear to fire at your opponent, but move fast or you'll miss your turn to hit the ball!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Simple to learn, but hard to master.\r\n- One player against the computer, or two players with a friend.\r\n- Try to beat the computer on all 20 tables in the single player campaign.\r\n- Choose the table for your competition, or select random, and the table changes after every point.\r\n- Use powerups to fire at your opponent and shrink or freeze their paddle.\r\n- Use the different styles of bumpers to send the ball where your opponent least expects.\r\n- Lots of multi-player fun!",
