    "description": "Take up arms as the tough-as-nails General Akamoto, a bone-faced commander who continues to fight even through the cold dark of death itself. Skulls of the Shogun is an arcade-style turn-based strategy game optimized for tactical and adaptive play. Command stoic skeletal warriors, call upon mercurial animal spirit-monks for power and guidance, and consume the skulls of their enemies to gain fiendish new powers.  Get ready to take on the afterlife through an extensive 10-15 hour single-player campaign, local multiplayer, and turn-by-turn online multiplayer for up to 4 players!\r\n\r\n\"...we found Skulls of the Shogun to be an absolutely enjoyable experience – so much so that we gave it a perfect score.\"\r\n5/5 - Joystiq\r\n\r\n\"Fast, compact and yet consistently thoughtful, there's nothing else quite like Skulls of the Shogun - and, for me, it earns its place amongst the genre's greats. \" \r\n9/10 - Eurogamer \r\n\r\n\"Equal parts quirky and complex, it only comes to prove that the glory days of this often forgotten genre aren’t quite gone.\" \r\n8.6/10 - Gametrailers",
