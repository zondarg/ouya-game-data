    "description": "\"A fast-paced and relentlessly hard racer, Fluid SE is well worth your time. 8 out of 10\" - PocketGamer\r\n\r\nFluid SE is a thrilling time-trial racer mixed with the arcade gameplay of Pac-Man, brought to you by Radiangames, creator of Inferno+, JoyJoy, Super Crossfire, and more. Speed through the mazes to collect the dots, find the optimal path, and avoid the swarms of spectres.\r\n\r\nIn Fluid: Special Edition, you guide Streak (a speedy black fish) through 40 levels filled with dots, obstacles, and powerups. Each dot you collect spawns a spectre that tries to chase you down, while the powerups give you a temporary upperhand, either with a speed boost, a vortex, or spectre-bursting spikes.\r\n\r\n* Finish the levels as fast you can and you're rewarded with up to 5 stars.\r\n\r\n* Levels are unlocked in groups, with each group requiring a minimum amount of stars.\r\n\r\n* Includes bonus and turbo levels.\r\n\r\n* 5-star times aren't initially shown, but getting a 4-star or higher time will reveal that level's 5-star time.\r\n\r\n* Track your progress with 12 achievements.\r\n\r\n* Amazingly smooth and accurate controls.",
