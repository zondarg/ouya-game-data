    "description": "Neo-San Francisco, 2064 AD. Your life as a struggling journalist is interrupted by the world's first sapient machine, a ROM (Relationship and Organizational Manager) named Turing. Together, you and the quirky robot will encounter a colorful cast of locals and overcome challenges as you uncover the city’s secrets behind the overlapping futures of technology and humanity. \r\n\r\nRead Only Memories is a new cyberpunk adventure that will take you on a journey of puzzle-solving and exploring as you investigate the mysterious world and characters of Neo-San Francisco. Inspired by classics like Gabriel Knight and Snatcher, ROM is a retrofuturistic take on the point and click adventure genre that features a rich mature narrative and unique gameplay challenges hidden within the beautiful interactive pixel scenes. The deeper you delve into the life of your missing friend, the further you get entangled into this tale about the dark side of technology. \r\n\r\nCan you survive in Neo-SF? Or will the mystery go unsolved?\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n- Dynamic narrative defined by player choices, with over 10 hours of dialogue, exploration, and gameplay challenges with multiple solutions. \r\n- BAFTA-nominated voice actors Adam Harrington and Dave Fennoy guide immersion in the aesthetics along with the exclusive synth-driven original soundtrack by 2 Mello and the retro futuristic pixel art style of JJSignal. \r\n- A vibrant cast of characters populate the world, as the rich interactive encounters with allies and enemies alike will unearth world-changing revelations.\r\n\r\n“The perfect blend of new ideas and old school charm... one of the most memorable experiences I've had all year.” \r\n9/10 – GameRevolution \r\n\r\n“It spreads a message of empathy — about acceptance and understanding of people's differences — by investing you emotionally in its characters through good storytelling.” \r\n9/10 – Syfy \r\n\r\n“A memorable game that's hard not to like and recommend to others... inclusive and accessible to just about everyone.” \r\n8/10 – Destructoid \r\n\r\n“It's like a Telltale game, Phoenix Wright, and Snatcher had some sort of millennial cyberpunk baby.” \r\n4/5 – The Escapist \r\n\r\n“ROM is a resounding success and one of the most affecting adventures I've ever had.” \r\n8/10 – GameSpot",
