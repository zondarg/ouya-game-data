    "description": "Gridlock is an arena-based shooter that sees you take control of four gun emplacements. In the middle of the grid, a variety of abstract yet lethal geometric shapes emerge which will destroy your turrets. Unless, of course, you can shoot the shapes first. Game over comes when/if all your turrets are destroyed.\r\n \r\nGridlock harkens back to a time when games were about beating your own high-score and also about shooting abstract shapes. Nothing more, nothing less. Supports XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 controllers!",
