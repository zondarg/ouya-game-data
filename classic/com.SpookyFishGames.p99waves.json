    "description": "99 Waves to Die is a twin stick arcade shooter, inspired by the arcade games, and 8-bit home consoles/computers, of the 1980′s.\r\n\r\nRemember when video games used to be insanely difficult?\r\nWhen you used to spend £’s in the local arcade trying to get the high score?\r\nWhen having your three letter initials/acronym at the top of the table meant you were the king?\r\nWell we do, and that is why we have created 99 Waves to Die.\r\nA ship, 3 lives, limited smart-bombs and scarce power-ups is all you have to try and survive the waves of enemies that rally against you.\r\nWith voxel based graphics, inspired by 80′s video game classics & excellent 8-bit audio fx, 99 Waves to Die will take you back to those seedy, dark, smoke filled arcades of your childhood. Re-live the 80′s heyday of the arcade, but without the 10p’s.\r\nCan you survive to see Wave 99?",
