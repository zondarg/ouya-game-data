    "description": "Unleash your imagination and craft your own world with this awesome retro 8-bit world builder game! The Sandbox is a world building and crafting game based on pixel art 8-bit games from the 80s and 90s -- create a universe or destroy it -- the only limitations on what you can do in this game come from your own mind! This classic video game lets you use basic building blocks like stone, water and soil to build and craft your own world. You can then add mud and sand to start vegetation growing. Finally, add in people, plants and animals and watch what happens next! The more you play this mosaic game, the more access you’ll gain to complex elements such as non-organic elements like light bulbs, metal and famous buildings. This classic game allows you to populate your universe with creations both technological and natural for hours of “god like” fun. The Sandbox is an entire universe in the palm of your hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the press says:\r\nThe Sandbox is a fantastically inventive mobile game that encourages players to create entire worlds and works of art!\" ~Cult Of Mac \r\n\r\n\"It’s kind of hard to get bored with so many toys to play with.” ~4.5/5 from 148Apps\r\n\r\n“The Sandbox straddles the line between game and art project, rewarding players for creativity while giving them near-infinite possibilities.” ~4/5 from TouchArcade\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\n\t•\tBest World Building Games (iTunes)\r\n\t•\tBest Games of 2012 and 2013!
