    "description": "Bible text selected:\n\nGENESIS 50:20\n\nBut as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\n\nThe Game represents some of the battles I had in my mind during the process of the birth of my 1st child, which was born a month premature, and the time shortly thereafter. From the before the birth, during the operation and the month in the NICU, up until the bringing of the baby home for the first time, just a few of the negative thoughts I personally had to battle against.\n\nThe best part about this testimony is how it was featured (moreso from my wife's point of view) in our local newspaper.\n\nThe article can be seen here:\n\nhttps://www.cassville-democrat.com/story/2462940.html",
