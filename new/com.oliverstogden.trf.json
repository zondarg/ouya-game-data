    "description": "TRF - OUYA Edition is a port of The Race Factory to the OUYA console for the 2020 Winter Ouya Jam. It is a free version of the game, with some features removed to make it run on the OUYA.\n\nThe AI does less calculations and therefore is quite a bit slower than the equivalent AI on PC. So you may find the game a little easy.\nFEATURES OF THE OUYA EDITION:\n\n    8 Vehicle Classes (Street, Sports, Super, Hyper, Karts, Formula, Trucks, Boats)\n    16 Tracks (4 are removed compared to PC Edition due to performance issues.)\n    3 Battle Arenas\n    9 Game Modes (Race, Elimination, Drift, Zen, Infection, Pass The Bomb, Hold The Gold, King of the Hill, Return the Flag)\n    1-4 Player local multiplayer\n    Event settings such as weapons, drafting, catch-up etc. can be changed.\n    Use in-game coins to buy cosmetic changes for your vehicles.\n\nCONTROLS:\n\n    O - Fire Weapon, Confirm Button\n    Y - Reset Car\n    RT - Accelerate\n    LT - Brake\n    RB - Pause\n    LB - Toggle Player Names\n    L3 - Toggle Headlights\n    Left Stick / Left/Right D-Pad - Steer\n\nTested Controllers: OUYA Controller & Wired Xbox 360 Controller.\nKnown Issues:\n\n    Sometimes buttons can't be clicked in the menu on an OUYA controller.\n    AI gets stuck on Ocean Battle Arena.\n    Poor Performance in battle modes.\n    Poor Performance in split-screen.\n    If multiple controllers are connected to the OUYA, they should join as a player, or else the cursor may not be able to be moved.\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter for regular Dev updates on the PC edition: https://twitter.com/O_Stogden",
